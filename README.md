# Python Bot Template by Nimo (aka Alex Nalin)


This is the core base of my bots and has the below features:

- config and logger is loaded only once
- Log level can be set directly via config.json
- Message handler and @mentioned users is parsed
- Docker file ready for deployments
- Help Menu/table is already defined
